      A privacy-first educational assessment platform enabling researchers
      and content creators to deploy tests to thousands of students
      nationwide without collecting personal identifying information.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Built dual applications: an administration portal for test deployment
      and management, and a student testing interface with real-time
      response collection. Custom data extraction and aggregation pipelines
      process assessment metrics for research analysis.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">
      <strong>Key Innovation:</strong> Developed a custom "Replay Service"
      that captures and streams DOM events, mouse movements, and keystrokes
      via WebSockets, allowing researchers to observe student sessions in
      real-time or replay recorded sessions with synchronized notesâ€”all
      while maintaining strict privacy compliance.
